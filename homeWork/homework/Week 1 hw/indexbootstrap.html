		 Former school teacher and impending coder. My last five years have been spent as a teacher and 4 years before that were spent becoming one. Although things were not always easy, the eager students who came 10 minutes early to class, those who waved their arm around enthusiastically to ask and answer questions and the huge smile on a student's face when they earned an excellent grade are some of the things that kept me going. These years have been incredibly insightful from the people i’ve met to the things i’ve dealt with and I can honestly say that I don’t regret anything. This being said, this journey has come to an end and it’s time for me to fulfill my passion.<br>
About a year ago I found myself researching more about coding and the more I learned, the more amazed I was. It was incredible how I could make new things come to life by a touch of a few buttons. I was captivated with the process of creating beautiful things that didn't exist before. It was pleasurable, addicting and I believe it's what I was destined to do. My name is Wahid Carvan and I am on my way to becoming a coder.<br>  </div>
